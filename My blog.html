<P>I am good at researching on topics related majorly on corporate finance. I am passionate about financial instruments analysis. I recently participated in The Nairobi Securities Exchange 2017 Investment Challenge and was awarded a certificate for participation. It’s a challenge where participants are given a chance to trade in a simulation of the real securities exchange market with an initial amount whereby you are required to invest by buying shares of listed companies, submit research on the same and participate actively in discussion forums.
I have basic computer skills, research skills in the use of resources such as Google Scholar and proficiency in the use of Zotero; which I majorly use for storage of my research papers and referencing. I have proficiency in the use of APA referencing system, a recognized system which is recommended and used in the education curriculum that I go through. 
I am currently pursuing a professional course, Certified Public Accountant (CPA). I am also currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in finance, currently in my second year of study

<P>The objective of this Standard is to prescribe the accounting treatment for inventories. A primary issue in accounting for inventories is the amount of cost to be recognised as an asset and carried forward until the related revenues are recognised. This Standard provides guidance on the determination of cost and its subsequent recognition as an expense, including any write-down to net realisable value.
